            <p>My experience of learning the basic of web development is very interesting. For someone who is not an expert in coding, I found it good. From other modules on the single assignment, I like it. There have been ups and downs on the coding. When I started to code, I have done a few exercises that Thomas gave me. When I started to code, I was struggling. The code shows right on the website however when I was using the validator check for the website there was a lot of errors. From example is the start of the code I put html instead of using the !DOCTYPE html. When I asked Mark for help, he told me a mistake. So, when I have done it, I use the validator and I got no errors. What I learned was when you think you are finished with the code on HTML you have to check the validator to show no errors.</p>
        
            <p>When coding the CSS was very straightforward. The basic was very simple but I was in for a challenged. Trying to use the grid method on CSS was very stressful. Every time I tried to do it; it won’t show up on the page. But looking through my notes on the topic 3 revision I how I didn’t name the grid areas. I successfully used the grid method and the layout is the same for everything.</p>
        
            <p>For doing the mobile css, I had to change the layout to moz-inline-stack so that is will be easy to see the screen.</p>
        
            <p>Trying to do the hamburger icon was also challenged. Trying to make the CSS as mobile was very difficult. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get it to work.</p>
        
            <p>For the Font and colours I made the front as Calibri because it is easy to read and I used that style on word and PowerPoint. The colours of website were unique. I made the font colours different and clear to read it.</p>
